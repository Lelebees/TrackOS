# TrackOS
Github repository for the TrackOS script for Space Engineers.

You can find the script on the Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2358717289

There is no mod.io release for TrackOS. There will not be unless someone else wishes to continue this project.


Please use this GitHub repo as an issue tracker/ code source. You can freely copy and use TrackOS so long as you do not steal the script. (With which I mean, copy the script and call it your own. If you wish to make small changes, these are allowed, but please credit me for making the original.)
